# Nature Tracker

**A Blog App by Valerio**

**Project Focus:** Hardware and Sensors

## Introduction

I’ve attempted to build this blog app three times:

1. **Initial Attempt:** I started the app on my own but failed miserably. I struggled with basic navigation and could not get things working.
   
2. **Second Attempt:** I followed a Udemy tutorial to create an expense tracker and used that as a base for my blog app. However, the complexity of the project made it hard to manage, especially after a break.

3. **Current Attempt:** In my latest effort, I worked on a smart trash app as part of the POE project, which introduced me to Flutter. I decided to use the smart trash app as a template for my blog app to avoid starting from scratch.

## Coverage

The app should include the following features:

- **Add a Blog:** Create and add new blog entries.
- **Remove a Blog:** Delete existing blog entries.
- **Edit a Blog:** Modify blog entries.
- **Like Button:** Allow users to like blog entries.
- **Backend Integration:** Connect to a backend to save blog entries.
- **API Documentation:** Provide Swagger documentation for POST, DELETE, and PUT requests related to blog entries.

The app will also focus on hardware and sensors:

- **Camera:** For taking photos.
- **Movement Sensor:** To track steps.
- **Location Coordinates:** To log the location where each blog entry is created.
- **Barometer:** To measure atmospheric pressure and estimate altitude.
- **Microphone:** To capture audio, potentially for adding voice notes to blog entries.

## Why "Nature Tracker"?

The app is named "Nature Tracker" because it’s designed to let users create and manage blogs on the go. 
Users can start a new trip and add multiple blog entries throughout the journey. 
While walking, hiking, or engaging in other outdoor activities, users can capture photos, record audio, and add brief texts to save their experiences. 
By the end of the trip, they will have a collection of blog entries with photos and audio, documenting their journey in a convenient and organized way.
